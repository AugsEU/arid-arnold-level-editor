The Arid Arnold level editor was an internal tool used to develop [Arid Arnold](https://github.com/AugsEU/arid-arnold)'s "aux" files.

### How to use

First you need to clone the Arid Arnold repository. Then go to Content/Campaigns/MainCampaign/Levels and use the program to open a png. It will then create (or overwrite ) the corresponding aux file for that level.

You can then add entities using Add -> Entity. Then click on where you want the entity to be. When an Entity is selected you can configure it's properties on the right panel.
